  <p>
    Hi, my name is Andrea Efthyvoulou.  I'm a technology and security enthusiast who enjoys various nerd things such as Anime, Cosplay, and Video Games.  I enjoy writing about technology and technology related subjects.  I am currently teaching myself HTML and I work as a IT Specialist professionally.  Eventually I hope to get my <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security">Security+</a> certification, and become a IT Security Analyst.  In the mean time I hope to learn as much as I can.  I am also transgender and will be sharing some of the things that I've gone through on my blog.
